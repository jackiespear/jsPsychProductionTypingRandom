# A production effect and directed forgetting effect experiment
### A jsPsych experiment

This is recognition production effect and directed forgetting experiment with unrelated words.

Participants are randomly assigned to do a production effect or direceted forgetting experiment. From there, they are then randomly assigned to a pure read/forget condition, a pure produce/remember condition, or a mixed-list condition. The cue to produce/remember or read/forget is presented 1 second after stimulus presentation.

Between-subjects conditions:

Procedure: production effect or directed forgetting <br>
Study list type: mixed, pure-produce/remember, pure-read/forget <br>

On trials where participants are instructed to produce/remember, words will be presented in green. On trails where participants are instructed to read/forget, words will be presented in red. Production is accomplished by typing, and typing is recorded, but not mirrored to the screen. When the cue to produce/remember or read/forget is presented after stimulus presentation, each word is presnted in black font for 1 second, colored font for 3 seconds, and then the screen is cleared for 500ms.

After the study phase, participants will be given a standard yes/no recognition test. They will be tested on all of the words that they studied, with an equal amount of words that they did not study. If partcipants were randomly assigned to the directed forgetting procedure, they will be instructed to indicated that they remember a word, regardless of the memory cue that was presented along with it during the study phase.
